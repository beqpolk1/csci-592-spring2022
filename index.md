This is the course website for my independent study at Montana State University during spring 2022.

**Course Number**: CSCI 592-001
**Instructor**: David Millman

### Course Description

This independent study will focus on polyglot persistence, i.e. the use of heterogeneous data storage paradigms and technologies to meet the data needs of an application. Specifically, the course will consider the difficulties that arise in a polyglot persistence environment and techniques for coping with these challenges. It will focus on "universal" models that have been or are being developed that allow multiple database paradigms, including relational, to work together in a more cohesive manner, and apply these ideas to solve problems in a real-world polyglot persistence system.

### Site Content

I will post content to the site during each week of the course. For the first 12 weeks these will be writeups reflecting on a weekly reading. The posts for the remainder of the course will be updates on the status of a course project. The project proposal will also be posted to the course website.
