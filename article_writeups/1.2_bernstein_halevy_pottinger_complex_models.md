This article by Bernstein, Halevy, and Pottinger provides a detailed outline for a potential system that can perform model management tasks including storage, querying, and transformations or mappings between models. Their use of “vision” in the title is appropriate, as there is little discussion of implementation and they do not present any pseudocode or algorithms. Still, this paper develops foundational definitions and notation in a formal way that would be necessary for any more advanced functions, and the fact that the authors were able to afford so much detail to these basic aspects without delving into higher-level functionality speaks to the potential depth of the topic.

One potential drawback of Bernstein, Halevy, and Pottinger’s research is that their sketch of a data model and its management is built around an object-oriented paradigm that may no longer be as fashionable as it was at the time of publication. Their data model relies on the notions of objects, properties, relationships, and classes, and is architected with an object-oriented or object-relational database or system in mind as the supporting technology. My own experience with object-oriented databases is limited, although it’s my understanding such systems are no longer “state of the art” and other data storage paradigms have proven superior. Not only that, but a good deal of the theoretical applications described in the paper discuss XML and XML DTD (document type definition), as opposed to more modern data interchange formats such as JSON.

However, the authors do develop some very interesting ideas and concepts that may prove to have lasting relevance. For one, they make several allusions to the fact that their object-oriented data model can also be represented as a graph; relationships do play a key role in much of the functionality. As such, it is possible their ideas could be applied through a graph context that would provide a more general approach suitable to a wide range of applications. Additionally, they offer some formal ways of defining a model, operations on a model, and what it means to have a mapping from one model to another. These formal definitions and explanations seem critical to creating a theoretical framework that can support interactions, mappings, and operations between models of disparate data sources.

Bernstein et al. provided a diagram of the structure of a mapping object; it is reproduced below with some additional notation labeling specific ideas from their description. This diagram was particularly helpful for understanding the idea of the “composition” operation, which seems analogous to transitivity between model maps.

Another point of interest was the authors’ decision to define both models and model mappings as first-class entities. In their words, “A model is a composite object containing objects and relationships.” In turn, model mappings are also models, but they dictate a correspondence between two other models and how one can be mapped to the other. Operations on models are defined to always return other models, which means operations can be nested or chained together, models can include other models, and mappings can map from model to model or from mapping to mapping. This is similar to the approach taken in [1], and it seems important to ensure that any definition or structure of models and model mapping is able to describe and operate on itself in order to provide an appropriate degree of flexibility.

Yet true to the idea of only a “vision”, even the formal definitions provided were somewhat unspecific and many details are deliberately ignored; this provided for a strange mixture of technical, fine-grained descriptions and an exploration of general concepts without any specific implementations. The authors identify many challenges throughout the course of their piece, such as “Find appropriate representations of model mappings that trade off expressiveness of semantics with the goal of keeping operations generic across a wide set of model type,” and “What are good structures for the result of matching models that have different structure?” Many of these challenges could foster several papers and large amounts of research on their own, so it is understandable that Bernstein et al. would only mention them.

Overall, I was excited to read a paper that got more into the dirty work of defining what a model *is*, what a model mapping *is*, and how mappings can transform between models. I am optimistic that despite the older technologies used and discussed in this paper, the underlying ideas may prove to be valuable for integrating and managing heterogeneous modern databases. The relational paradigm, which was also often mentioned in “A Vision…”, is still very relevant, and some of the other discussed data model paradigms such as XML, semantic networks, and time-indexed object-oriented databases may be analogous enough to sources such as document stores, graph databases, and column stores that the techniques described by the authors are effective. In particular, I will be eager to see if some of the later papers borrow ideas from this one, and whether the research around data models for NoSQL data stores seems compatible with the concept of a model as presented in “A Vision…”.
