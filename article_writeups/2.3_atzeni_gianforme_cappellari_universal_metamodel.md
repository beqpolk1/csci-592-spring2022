This was the second reading featuring Paolo Atzeni as an author, the first being [Data Modeling in the NoSQL World](2.1_atzeni_et_al_data_model_nosql.md). Both were heavily focused on data modeling techniques for heterogeneous systems and the advantages and usefulness of performing such data modeling. However, the process and model presented here was much more robust and had a much more intricate specification compared to that in “Data Modeling in the NoSQL World”, but this article also did not make many recommendations or suggestions on model design.

One aspect that helps explain the wide difference between the two data modeling articles is the fact that this one (“A Universal Metamodel…”) was published about a  decade earlier, and focused on many data storage paradigms that are less widely used today (such as XML schema definition (XSD) and object-relational). The explosion of interest in NoSQL databases in the intervening time probably motivated Atzeni to reconsider the areas where data modeling research was needed, and what sort of techniques would be valuable there.

Although it was impressive to see the level of abstraction that Atzeni et al. carried out to create their universal metamodel, I will admit that I found the description in the paper somewhat hard to follow. In my understanding, the lower level of the universal metamodel deals with schemas. There can be a “model”, which corresponds to a specific schema under a specific data modeling paradigm. A specific application could perhaps be represented with multiple models. For example, an application that tracks employee attributes and employee membership in departments could have either an entity-relationship model or an object-oriented model, depending on the implementation. Elements of such models might be “employee entity” (ER), “employee name field” (OO), “employee number attribute” (ER), and “department class” (OO).

Adjusting terminology, Atzeni et al. explain that these individual models are composed of “constructs”, which represent, “a ‘structural’ concept of a data model…for example, entity, attribute of entity, and binary relationship for the ER [model] and class, field, and reference for the OO [model].” The notion of construct serves as a mechanism for generifying the elements of specific models, in order to begin to find commonalities between different models.

At the level above model is “metamodel”, which groups together the constructs used by different models for a specific application. The metamodel describes individual models in terms of the constructs that they allow, but does so in a format that can be applied across models of different paradigms. For the example application given above, the metamodel construct of “entity” may be specifically present in the ER model as an “employee entity”, and the metamodel construct of “field” may be specifically present in the OO model as “employee name field”. In other words, the metamodel specifies the constructs that that a given model paradigm can use, and an instance of a metamodel (in regards to a schema) has specific elements corresponding to the allowed constructs as applied to the application domain. A metamodel itself, though, describes a data modeling paradigm, and is independent of any particular application or schema.

Somewhat adjacent to the level of metamodel is that of “meta-supermodel”. The meta-supermodel abstracts the constructs in the metamodel one level further, associating each construct with a meta-construct that spans multiple metamodels. For instance, an “entity” in the ER metamodel and a “class” in the OO metamodel can both correspond to the meta-construct of “abstract” in the meta-supermodel.

Finally, there is the “supermodel”, which is a level of abstraction above a model but below the meta-supermodel. The supermodel takes the elements of the model and associates them together based on the meta-constructs that those elements correspond to through the metamodel. For example, the supermodel recognizes that there may be an “employee” abstract in the ER model and also an “employee” abstract in the OO model. The supermodel is a way of representing the model in terms of meta-constructs, which in turn leads to model independence; we can begin to compare all the constructs of one data modeling paradigm with the constructs of another and find where they may be the same.

To that end, the authors provide some brief discussion on how equality can be defined between constructs, and therefore how operators such as union, difference, and intersection could be defined between models. These comparisons would take place at the supermodel level. This discussion was interesting and may provide some starting points for detecting and researching similarities between data stored in heterogeneous systems. Atzeni et al. also spend a fair bit of time expounding the meta-constructs they consider as part of the meta-supermodel, and give examples of how many common data paradigms (such as ER, OO, OR, and XSD) could be captured by their universal meta-model. Again, these would be useful for developing specific techniques between data model paradigms.

Another interesting contribution was the decision to capture and manage all the metadata corresponding to the model levels in a relational framework (see above images). The authors mentioned how difficult it can be to effectively manage, access, and compare model metadata, especially for large and complicated schemas. Defining a relational schema for each of the four levels of abstraction (model, metamodel, meta-supermodel, and supermodel) to track the constructs used and their properties seems like a smart approach.

Overall, I had the impression that the authors presented a powerful modeling approach in this paper, yet it was difficult to fully comprehend. A very useful exercise could be adopting this universal metamodel to the document store and column store NoSQL paradigms. This would not only improve my own understanding of the techniques, but also apply them in a modern context that may be useful for my project moving forward.
