  * A machine learning application?
* Create a model that can work with at least two types of database system not covered by existing research

* Take Bernstein et al.'s ("A Vision of Management of Complex Models") model structure/definition and implement through a graph DB
  * "Challenge 1: Develop a mechanism for representing models and for storing those representations"
* Extend the ideas presented by Bernstein et al. to include modern types of NoSQL data stores
