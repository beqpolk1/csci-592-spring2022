# Potential Project Ideas

* Extending an existing model to have new functionality or support more operations, perhaps application specific
* Create a model that can work with at least two types of database system not covered by existing research

* Develop a tool that can ingest data from multiple database paradigms, transform into a standardized format, feed to...
  * A web application?
  * A machine learning application?
* On a similar note: take "data lakes" and aggregate the data through universal modeling techniques, lift it into *some sort of space* to generate "point clouds" and then apply learning algorithms

* Take Bernstein et al.'s ("A Vision of Management of Complex Models") model structure/definition and implement through a graph DB
  * "Challenge 1: Develop a mechanism for representing models and for storing those representations"
* Extend the ideas presented by Bernstein et al. to include modern types of NoSQL data stores
* Work on challenge from Bernstein et al.'s paper to find "best matches" between models
  * Find like fields between models and some probability of those fields being the same
  * *Learn* the best match between model schemas

* Extend Atzeni et al.'s NoAM data model to graphs and column stores
* Prove isomorphisms between datastores using the NoAM data model
* Explore the mathematical representation and implications of the NoAM model and the design guidelines given by Atzeni et al.
